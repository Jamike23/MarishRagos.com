    <font color="tomato"><h2 style="text-align: center">Clarins Water Lip Stain</h2>
    <font color="black"><p>&emsp;  Clarins Water Lip Stain's transfer-proof formula - comprised of 77 percent water-as well as its slightly sheer finish. Key ingredients in the Best of Beauty winner include soothing aloe vera, moisturizing glycerin, and antioxidant-rich camellia sinensis leaf extract (aka green tea). Red Water (a candy-colored red, seen here) is one of four fun shades.</p>

    <font color="tomato"><h2 style="text-align: center">Colourpop Fresh Kiss Glossy Lip Stain</h2>
    <font color="black"><p>&emsp; Glossy formulas don't always have the staying power of a more matte finish, but Colourpop's Fresh Kiss Glossy Lip Stain shines and doesn't budge. The water-based tint keeps lips hydrated even after it dries down. The stain also has antioxidant-enriched guava and lychee extracts to protect the skin in this area from free-radical damage.</p>

    <font color="Tomato"><h2 style="text-align: center">Tonymoly Liptone Get It Tint</h2>
    <font color="black"><p>&emsp; The Tonymoly Liptone Get It Tint is a lightweight stain that made its debut in Korea with an endorsement from beloved K-pop group Monsta X. The product, which comes in reds, berry, and coral shade made its way to American shortly thereafter. Keep a tube in your purse because you never know when you're going to need a lip product that dries down instantly for a transfer-free finish.</p>
